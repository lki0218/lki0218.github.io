        <h2>Relationship of outcomes compared to goals originally set</h2>
       <br>My initial goal was to create a game that functions properly and includes characters, music, and beginning and ending pages. I was pleased with the outcome of my game, and while there was no music, all of the other factors mentioned above were present, and the game worked properly. <br>
