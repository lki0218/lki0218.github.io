        <h1>Relfection</h1>
       <p>My project was developed using the Pygarcade Python module. 
        In comparison to the previous programming language, Pyret, which was taught in the previous unit, 
        Python shares some similarities.
        However, the game format of this project stands out as a significant deviation from the data science focus of the Pyret projects. 
        It is worth noting that this project is related to Snap, which was covered in the initial unit of my computer science course. 
        While Snap and Python are distinct programming languages, both were utilized in the creation of games.</p>
